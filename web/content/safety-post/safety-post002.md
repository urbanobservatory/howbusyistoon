Government guidance is changing on 19th July as England moves to Step 4 of the roadmap. Everyone should 
be cautious whilst managing the risks as cases of COVID-19 remain high.  You should check locally as 
some organisations may still request that you wear a face covering while using public transport or 
you are in shops, banks or other indoor spaces.
