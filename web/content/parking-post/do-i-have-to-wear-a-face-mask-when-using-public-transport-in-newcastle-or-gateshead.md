Government guidelines state that it is a legal requirement to wear a face mask or sufficient covering like a scarf, if you are using public transport in England. A face covering is a covering of any type which covers your nose and mouth. Wearing a face mask or covering will be a condition of travel. Not wearing one could lead to a fine and you can be refused travel. This applies to everyone using buses, trains, Tyne and Wear Metro and ferries.
