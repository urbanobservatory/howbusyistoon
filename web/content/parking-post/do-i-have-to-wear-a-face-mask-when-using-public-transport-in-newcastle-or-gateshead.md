Government guidance is changing on 19th July as England moves to Step 4 of the roadmap. Everyone should be cautious 
whilst managing the risks as cases of COVID-19 remain high.  You should check locally as some providers may still 
request that you wear a face covering while using public transport.  Nexus have confirmed (15 July 2021) that
passengers must continue to use a face mask on the Tyne and Wear Metro.  You should also wear face coverings when 
inside bus stations and interchanges or travelling on the Shields Ferry.
