<p>How Busy Is… is here to help you feel safe and prepared when visiting your city centre. You have access to live footage of the most used streets, live data on car park capacity, links to transport information, and up to date rules and safety guidance from NE1, councils and government.</p>
<p>The platform was built in collaboration with Newcastle City Council, NE1, Newcastle University’s Research Software Engineering team, and hedgehog lab, using data from the Urban Observatory, and data analytics from National Innovation Centre for Data.</p>

<p>Version 1 of How Busy Is… was 1 of 11 funded collaborative projects through the Local Digital COVID-19 Challenge. Research was conducted by hedgehog lab with people all around the UK who gave valuable feedback and insight into what they would like to see on this website.</p>
